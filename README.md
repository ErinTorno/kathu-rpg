# Kathu RPG

A (tentatively named) dungeon-puzzle focused RPG written in Haskell using SDL2.

The project was aimed as a rewrite for a previous game written in a different language, and used as a means of learning Haskell for the author.

## Status

This project is far from finished. As of right now the player is only able to move around the screen with different tiles and props set up.
